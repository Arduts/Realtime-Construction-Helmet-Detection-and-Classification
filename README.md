# Realtime-Construction-Helmet-Detection-and-Classification

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an AI-based system for real-time detection and classification of construction helmets worn by workers on construction sites. The system utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to detect the presence of construction helmets in images and then classifies them as either "properly worn" or "improperly worn." The construction industry often requires workers to wear protective gear, and this system ensures compliance with safety regulations by automating the inspection process.

## Features
Real-time construction helmet detection and classification
Distinguish between "properly worn" and "improperly worn" helmets
User-friendly interface for ease of use
High accuracy and robust performance

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/construction-helmet-detection.git](https://github.com/Arduts/Realtime-Construction-Helmet-Detection-and-Classification.git
```

## Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained model weights (if available) and place them in the appropriate directory.
```
## Usage Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd construction-helmet-detection
Run the application:
python app.py
```

Model Training
If you wish to train the model on your own dataset or fine-tune the existing model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset following the structure specified in the Dataset section.

Run the training script:

```
python train.py
Adjust hyperparameters and network architecture in train.py to suit your requirements.
```

Evaluate the trained model's performance using evaluate.py.

Dataset
The dataset used to train and evaluate the model is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can find the dataset at link-to-dataset.

To use your custom dataset, organize it as follows:

```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── properly_worn/
│   └── improperly_worn/
└── test/
    ├── properly_worn/
    └── improperly_worn/
```
